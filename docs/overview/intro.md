What is Alloy?
-------------------------


Alloy is a flexible platform that offers solutions to explore, define, connect, and integrate data into your business processes. Getting access to timely, accurate, and complete data is becoming increasingly more difficult to achieve. Why?

-   The amount, speed, and complexity of information is exploding exponentially.

-   Businesses often operate within data silos limiting opportunities to collaborate, connect, and communicate efficiently.

-   Data inventories are not well understood due to a lack of meaningful metrics such as usage and information flow.

The Alloy platform aims to provide solutions to these challenges. Learn about the different independent feature sets and how they add value to each data-driven organization. 

-   [***Alloy Cube***](/docs/getting-started/cube) (Cube) -- **Explore data** from various data stores through Excel-like operations.

-   [***Alloy Studio***](/docs/getting-started/studio) (Studio) -- **Describe and connect data** in business terms to create data models. Standardize terms and relationships across the entire organization to foster consistent data vocabulary. Express those data models in diagrams to facilitate the dialog between business and development team.

-   [***Alloy Graph***](/docs/getting-started/graph) (Graph) & [***Alloy Services***](/docs/getting-started/services) (Services) -- **Integrate data** in a self-serve manner by first browsing and navigating the data model and by then asking informed questions to the data through queries in [***Graph***](/docs/getting-started/graph). Power users that can register data-driven services (APIs) with a simple click of a button in [***Services***](/docs/getting-started/services) allowing the repeated and controlled usage of the queries. It's easy to build customized user interfaces with those APIs increasing both developer productivity and time to market of your data products. 

The Alloy platform is backed by an [Execution Engine](/docs/getting-started/execution) providing powerful insights and a robust [Change
Management (SDLC)](/docs/getting-started/sdlc) process that provides detailed operational metrics. What does this mean for you? Use your data models in your live business flows and rapidly transform into a data-driven organization with confidence.

Roadmap
-------------------------
The open sourcing of the Alloy platform is happening in 3 phases:

- **Phase 0** (Q4 2019): Deploy an external instance of Alloy to AWS servers and announce the intention to open source at the FINOS strategy forum.

- **Phase 1** (Jan 2020): Open source the Alloy language and Alloy Studio with limited functionality to a group of bank pilot users collaborating on a Derivatives model. In this release, Studio supports the creation of data models, model-to-model mappings, constraints and derivations. Features that are not yet available are model-to-database mappings and the execution of queries as services.

- **Phase 2** (Mid 2020): Open source full feature set of Studio along with the entire Alloy platform. Specifically, Cube, Graph, and Services. This opens up the opportunity to collaborate on even more use cases and the creation of a shared model inventory.
