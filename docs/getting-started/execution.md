Alloy provides an execution feature to run queries, constraints and model-to-model/model-to-database transformations. 

Use live data (pulled from physical data stores) or generated sample data as inputs to the executions and review the results to to test your model as you build it.  

You can save these tests and continue to enhance your data models with the comfort that your changes can be tested against expected results.
