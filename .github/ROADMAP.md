## Phase 0 (Completed)


## Phase 1 (In Progress)
### Phase 1 Goals
#### Phase 1 Goal 1: Evaluate shared modeling using Alloy and and define dollaboration model for further model development
* Evaluate how shared modeling can work using Alloy and define the best process to work together, by assessing: 
    * Governance process 
    * Collaboration amongst banks 
    * Technical solution 
* Success Criteria
    * Basic fluency in Alloy by non-GS modelers using Alloy
    * Functional areas of interest identified and working groups to model in those areas commenced
    * Feedback on Alloy shared with Goldman development team such that said feedback can be incorporated, as feasible, into the version of Alloy released as open source at the start of Phase 2 

#### Phase 1 Goal 2: Using Alloy collectively develop a model or model extension
* Find a good use case, with propensity for value creation through shared modeling and data shaping,  and then work on (i.e., model) something “production relevant” 
    * Ideally shared models can and should also be contributed back to respective standards bodies such as ISDA for derivatives (e.g., proposed changes to the CDM) 
    * FINOS members and community can provide further momentum by implementing models and supporting standards by convention
    * Stretch goal to submut changed back to respective standards body (ISDA) and, better still, see it accepted into the standard
* Success Criteria
    * Support of standards body (ISDA)
    * 

#### Meeting Minutes
* Alloy General Monthly Meeting
* Alloy Pilot Meeting
